A program launcher for xmonad and other stand-alone window managers. It
lists the contents of the user's $PATH (through dmenu) and parses commands
using shell syntax.

**Configuration**

A per-user configuration file (~/.drunrc) is created by copying the example
configuration file when the program is first run. There is currently one
option.

    dmenu

        The dmenu command, including any arguments.

**Building**

You need dmenu to use this.

The program can be installed with the included distutils script.
