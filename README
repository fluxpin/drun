A program launcher for xmonad and other stand-alone window managers. It
lists the contents of the user's $PATH (through dmenu) and parses commands
using shell syntax.

**Configuration**

A per-user configuration file (~/.drunrc) is created by copying the example
configuration file when the program is first run. There are currently two
options.

    dmenu

        The dmenu command, including any arguments.

    commands

        A list of special commands and their definitions. The first element
        of each two-tuple is a Python regular expression, the second is a
        command.

        Commands are matched against each regular expression before they
        are parsed or executed. If a match is found, the original command
        is replaced with a new command from the corresponding tuple. Any
        text of the form {#} in the new command is replaced with part of
        the match, where {0} refers to the entire match (which may not be
        the entire original command) and {1} through {N} refer to regular
        expression groups if any exist.

**Building**

You need dmenu to use this.

The program can be installed with the included distutils script.
